# UEProjectUtility
UEProjectUtility is a C++ based utility tool specifically designed for Unreal Engine projects. The tool offers a couple of primary functions which are essential during the development lifecycle of an Unreal Engine game.

## Features:
1. **Project Renaming**: This tool can assist in renaming Unreal Engine projects, changing references within files to ensure a smooth and error-free transition.

2. **Project Cleaning**: This tool also offers the functionality to clean Unreal Engine projects by deleting generated and temporary files that can be safely removed, thus helping in keeping the project directory clean and well-organized.

## How to Use:
The tool is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It displays a menu with the available options for the user to choose from. The options are:

1. **Rename project**: Allows you to input an existing project's name and the new name you want to give to the project. The tool then proceeds to rename the project and change references within files.

2. **Clean project**: Lets you input the name of an existing project. The tool then cleans the project by deleting generated and temporary files.

3. **Exit**: Terminate the application.

Once an option is chosen, the user is then asked to input the necessary information depending on the chosen operation. The tool then handles the rest.
